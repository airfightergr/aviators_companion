## AVIATOR's COMPANION

A desktop app with some tools useful to flight sim aviators. Currently only for Linux.

### What can do (still WIP)
1. Unit conversions.
    * Temperature
    * Weights
    * Length
    * Fuel volume and weigh calculation
2. Airports weather information.
    * Metars
    * TAFs
3. Future additions not determined yet.

**CAUTION: Use only for Flight Simulation! Do not use it in real aviation!**
